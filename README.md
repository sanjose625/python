# Telecom Churn Analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook

This project focuses on performing churn analysis for a telecom company using Python's popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Churn analysis is a crucial task for businesses to understand and predict customer attrition, which can help them devise strategies to retain valuable customers and improve overall customer satisfaction.

# Project Overview

Telecom companies often face challenges related to customer retention, as customers switch service providers due to various factors. In this project, we aim to analyze historical customer data and gain insights into customer churn behavior.

# Key Objectives

Data Preprocessing: We begin by cleaning and preparing the raw telecom dataset to make it suitable for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using Pandas and Seaborn, we perform an in-depth exploration of the data to uncover patterns and trends that may be contributing to churn.
Visualization: We utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the results and present our findings effectively.

# Jupyter Notebook

The entire analysis is documented and presented in a Jupyter Notebook. This interactive environment allows us to blend code, visualizations, and text explanations seamlessly, providing a comprehensive and reproducible analysis.

# Libraries Used

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array processing.
Seaborn: For creating attractive and informative statistical visualizations.
Matplotlib: For generating various plots and charts.
